# ArtistDiversity

Suggestions:

[ ] Survey Instrument Rmarkdown document needs to be cleaned so it displays more nicely on the web. Currently, bullet points display as numbers.

[ ] Maybe have the Survey Instrument as the third tab instead of second

[ ] I really like the graph about gender distribution, but can we clean it up a little (x-axis label seems weird, maybe better to have proportions there going from 0% to 100%. Order of listing museums

[x] Make the sidebar less wide so there is more room for displaying the data table.
